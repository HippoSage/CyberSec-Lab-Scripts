## 📫 About Me
I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a Master’s in Information Systems (March 2026) and certifications including ISC2 CC (May 2025) and SSCP (June 2025). My goal is to contribute to a SOC or SecOps team while continuing to grow into cloud and system security.

**Rogue Packet Watchdog** is a custom-built Python script that monitors live network traffic for suspicious behavior, such as:

- Connections to uncommon ports
- Excessive connections to a single IP (possible C2 or brute-force behavior)
- Geolocation of remote IPs using public APIs

### 🔍 Features

- Real-time detection using `psutil`
- Logs alerts to `suspicious_connections.csv`
- Integrates with `ip-api.com` to identify country + organization
- Flag logic based on port usage, volume, and source

### 🧪 Sample Alert

[!] 2025-05-10 15:47:46 - Suspicious connection detected:
Remote IP: 20.59.87.227 | Port: 443 | Protocol: TCP
Reason: High connection count to 20.59.87.227
Geo: United States - Microsoft Azure Cloud (westus)

### 📂 Location
`/rogue_packet_watchdog/rogue_packet_watchdog.py`

### 🔧 Future Improvements
- Country-based filtering
- Auto-blocking IPs via Windows Firewall
- Optional email alerting or dashboard output
